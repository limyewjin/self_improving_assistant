# Self Improving Assistant

## How it started

Me: I want to start a repository that enables you to be the best assistant by allowing you
access to external tools such as python environment, calculator, internet searches, and more.
It can also optimize itself and make changes to its own code via git commands. Can you write
python code which can call yourself using openai api (using model "gpt-4") and allows for
extensions to be written.

Let's start with giving you access to python, terminal commands, and also the ability to run
git commands so that it can view code changes, files, and make new code submissions? Let's
keep it simple and make this a commandline program that a user can start, and then takes input
from the assistant (you) via a chat interface.

GPT-4: Certainly! I can provide you with some guidance on how to build such a system. However,
please keep in mind that implementing a fully functional assistant with the features you described
may take significant time and effort.

To get started, you can use the OpenAI API to access the GPT-4 model and generate responses to
user inputs. Here is some example Python code to accomplish that:

python
Copy code
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
This code initializes the OpenAI API with your API key and defines a function called generate_response that takes a prompt string as input and returns a response generated by the GPT-4 model.

To give the assistant access to external tools such as Python, terminal commands, and Git, you can use the subprocess module in Python. Here is an example of how to run a terminal command and capture its output:

python
Copy code
import subprocess

def run_command(command):
    process = subprocess.Popen(command.split(), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output, error = process.communicate()
    return output.decode("utf-8").strip()
This code defines a function called run_command that takes a string command as input, runs the command in a new subprocess, and returns the output of the command as a string.

Finally, to allow the assistant to view Git changes and make new submissions, you can use the gitpython module in Python. Here is an example of how to use GitPython to clone a Git repository and create a new commit:

python
Copy code
from git import Repo

def clone_repository(repository_url, local_path):
    Repo.clone_from(repository_url, local_path)

def make_commit(repository_path, commit_message):
    repo = Repo(repository_path)
    repo.git.add(".")
    repo.index.commit(commit_message)
    repo.remotes.origin.push()
This code defines two functions: clone_repository and make_commit. The clone_repository function takes a Git repository URL and a local path as input and clones the repository to the specified path. The make_commit function takes a repository path and a commit message as input, stages all changes in the repository, creates a new commit with the specified message, and pushes the commit to the remote repository.

Putting all of these pieces together, you can create a command-line interface for your assistant that allows users to interact with it via a chat interface. Here is an example of how to structure the code:

python
Copy code
while True:
    user_input = input("User: ")
    assistant_response = generate_response(user_input)
    print("Assistant:", assistant_response)

    # Handle user input
    if "python" in user_input:
        # Call Python
        python_code = input("Enter Python code: ")
        python_output = run_command("python -c '" + python_code + "'")
        print(python_output)
    elif "git" in user_input:
        # Call Git
        git_command = input("Enter Git command: ")
        git_output = run_command(git_command)
        print(git_output)
    elif "exit" in user_input:
        # Exit the program
        break
This code defines a loop that prompts the user for input, generates a response using the GPT-4 model, and handles user input based on keywords such as "python", "git", and "exit". If the user types "python", the assistant prompts the user for Python
```
